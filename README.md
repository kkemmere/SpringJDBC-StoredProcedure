# SpringJDBC-StoredProcedure
Intro to Spring JDBC. (MySQL & Java)<br/><br/>

Program connects to database and uses a prepared statement to query all product codes. Then 2-6 of those product codes are randomly chosen
to be included in the delimited string. The delimited string is then counted, put into an array and split. Final delimited string array is fed to a stored procedure one by one.<br/>

All data in the database is fake and used for testing only.<br/>
This program is the same as JDBC-StoredProcedure but it is now using the Spring Framework.<br/>
